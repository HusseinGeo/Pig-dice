              <ol>
                <li>To play you will need 2 to 10 players, one 6-sided dice, and a pencil and some paper for keeping score.</li>
                <li>If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing and loses all points he/she accumulated that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turntotal is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
                <li>First player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
              <ol/>
