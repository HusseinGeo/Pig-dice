              <ol>
                <li>To play you will need 2 to 10 players,one 6-sided dice,and a pencil and some paper for keeping score.</li>
                <li>If a player rolls a 1,they score nothing and loses all points he/she accumulated that turn,and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>If a player chooses to "hold",their turntotal is added to their score,and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
                <li>Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.</li>
                <li>First player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
